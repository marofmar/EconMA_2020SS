# Study Log as an MA student in Economics
#### Day 01: March 26 2020
* Thursday Classes: Macro-undergrad, Econometrics-undergrad, Behavioral Economics
* Made a github repo, to make and record constant daily improvements
* Reviewed Macro and Econometrics. Spent more time than expected. 

#### Day 02: March 27 2020
* Friday Class: Macroeconomics 
* Finished taking Statistics reviewing online lectures (Econometrics supplementary lectures)
* Tried to open an account to have an API access to make a stock trading program, but halted. Should try again in next week.
* Took Macroeconomics online lecture, learned about Hamiltonian. Should check other resources on Youtube and read textbook for better understanding. 
* Organized this week's class slides and notes in binders.

#### Day 03: March 28 2020 Sat
* Found my Intro to Statistics notes, and studied them. I was a good student indeed. 

#### Day 04: March 29 2020 Sun
* Submitted Behavior Economics homework2
* Codecademy C+
* Reviewing my old Stat notes
 
#### Day 05: March 30 2020 Mon
* Monday Class: Algorithms and its applications
* Reviewed recursive algorithms, and learned about stack, data structure
* Finished taking second week Macroeconomics video lectures; Hamiltonian and optimal control 
* Codecademy! 

#### Day 06: March 31 2020 Tue
* Tuesday Class: undergrad Macroeconomics, undergrad Econometrics
* I cannot believe the undergrad course contents which I took years ago,, sounds unfamiliar, and cannot explain the concepts in coherent ways to anyone! I neeeed to STUDY!
* And I have to admit that I forgot much of the basic Economics. Gotta work harder to be able to write my paper in this semester. 
* Reviewing math, as I forgot much of them.
* Spliting time in 15minutes and allocating tasks in small unit works for me. 

#### Day 07: April 01 2020 Wed
* Supposed to review and preview Econometrics and Macro, but spent time reading Microeconomics note "Econ 121b: Intermediate Microeconomics" by Professor Dirk Bergemann
* While reading 5.3 'Optimization Using the Lagrange Approach', found connections between Lagrangian multiplier and regularization algorithms in Deep learning. Everything is connected, and nothing new under the Sun! Yey! 

#### Day 08: April 02 2020 Thur
* Joined LeetCode 30 Day Leetcoding Challenge! Yay!
* Finished Behavioral Economics homework 3, and submitted
* Participated in an Economic experiment conducted in Behavioral Economics class and got 20 points
* Thursday class: Econometrics-undergrad, Macroeconomics-undergrad, gotta review the content ASAP! 

#### Day 09: April 03 2020 Fri
* NYU Deep Learning Spring 2020, Week 1 Lecture 1/2

#### Day 10: April 05 2020 Sun
* Contributed as a Korean translator to the NYU Pytorch Deep Learning course materials (Spring 2020)

#### Day 11: April 09 2020 Thur
* I thought todays was Wed, so missed 2 Thursday classes.... I can't believe this.......
* I am reading Ch6 Value Function and Comparative Statics of Econ121b: Intermediate MicroEcon
* Watched MIT Algorithm lecture video about Dynamic Programming, it was fun. 

#### Day 12: April 10 2020 Fri
* NYU Deep Learning Spring 2020, Week 1 Lecture 2/2
> Last question and answer about PCA, that was truly interesting, PCA only works when the manifold is linear, unless it will not tell anything, as it cannot find anything there. 

#### Day 13: April 12 2020 Sun
* Behavioral Economics online lectures: Fehr Schmidt model 
* Submitted a paper describing a situation that FS model can be used to analyze

#### Day 14: April 16 2020 Thur
* Behavioral Economics Zoom online class, learned about Market Game which has two proposers and one responder. This game can be analyzed with FS model.
* Econometrics (Undergrad) Zoom online class, today, finally I really understand what maximum likelihood is. Before, I could not be able to explain the difference between probability and maximum likelihood. To be honest, I mixed two different terms indicating the same thing. I should study more and more and more.

#### Day 15: April 19 2020 Sun
* Math for Economics reviewed as I forgot a lot of them
* Translated week6 of PyTorch Deep Learning into Korean

#### Day 16: April 20 2020 Mon
* Monday class: Algorithms and their applications
* Reviewed Brute Force and learned about Divide-and-Conquer

#### Day 17: April 22 2020 Wed
* Studied OS scheduling algorithms such as SJT, SRT and so forth. Submitted homework
* Reading Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis
* Very interested in Manim(https://github.com/3b1b/manim) 

#### Day 18: April 23 2020 Thur
* Undergrad Econometrics and Macroeconomics classes
* Maximum likelihood, Score matrix, Solow growth model

#### Day 19: April 26 2020 Sun
* Finished Korean translation about Deep Learning Pytorch Lesson6 (https://github.com/marofmar/pytorch-Deep-Learning/blob/master/docs/ko/week06/06-1.md)
